# Enabling HTTPS with cert-manager
This section briefly describes how to set up HTTPS for Smilr, using cert-manager and certificates issued by Let's Encrypt  
The information and configs are based on information taken from the Azure docs [https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/aks/ingress-tls](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/aks/ingress-tls)

## Important!
Change the email address in the issuer.*.yaml files, you can use any valid email address, just not mine!

## Steps

1. Install cert-manager. [Follow these steps](https://docs.cert-manager.io/en/latest/getting-started/install.html)

2. Install the cert issuers
```
kubectl apply -f issuer-staging.yaml
kubectl apply -f issuer-prod.yaml
```

4. Deploy Smilr using ingress using the configs found in [kubernetes/advanced](../advanced/) and use the `ingress-https.yaml`

5. The certificate might take a little while to validate and be issued the first time

## Notes
We deploy two issuers, one for Let's Encrypt staging and one for production. The rate limits on Let's Encrypt production are **extremely** restrictive, so only switch to the prod issuer when you are happy you won't be making many changes or requests
